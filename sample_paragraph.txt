Urban water distribution systems are complex infrastructure systems that require continuous monitoring and optimization. This system is designed to monitor, analyze, and manage water distribution networks using sensors, data collection modules, and analytical algorithms. The system collects data related to flow rate, pressure, and water quality parameters. The collected data is transmitted to a centralized platform for processing. The processed data is used to detect anomalies and generate alerts. This enables improved system performance and operational efficiency. The system supports decision-making and enhances sustainability. The system is scalable and cost-effective. The system improves reliability and reduces losses. The system provides benefits for urban water management.

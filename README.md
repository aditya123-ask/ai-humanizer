# AI Humanizer - Clean & Simple

Transform technical text into human-like writing that beats AI detection.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Add Your Text
Edit `sample_paragraph.txt` with your content to humanize.

### 2. Run the Humanizer
```bash
python ai_humanizer.py
```

### 3. Get Results
- Screen output shows before/after comparison
- Final result saved to `humanized_result.txt`

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Professional humanization quality
- ✅ AI detection resistance
- ✅ Technical accuracy preserved
- ✅ Single file input/output
- ✅ No extra files created

## 💡 Usage

1. Edit `sample_paragraph.txt` with any technical text
2. Run `python ai_humanizer.py`
3. Check `humanized_result.txt` for the humanized version
4. Test in AI detector - should show reduced scores

That's it! Simple, clean, effective.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
├── ai_humanizer.py          # Original humanizer (simple version)
├── self_improving_ai.py     # Advanced ML system (recommended)
├── sample_paragraph.txt     # Your input text
├── humanized_result.txt     # Humanized output
├── requirements.txt         # Dependencies
└── README.md               # This file
```

## 💡 Usage

### Simple Version (Basic Humanization)
```bash
python ai_humanizer.py
```

### Advanced Version (Self-Improving AI) - Recommended
```bash
python self_improving_ai.py
```

The advanced system includes:
- Continuous learning from each transformation
- Storage-efficient knowledge base
- Performance tracking and optimization
- Adaptive prompt engineering

## 📊 Learning Statistics

The self-improving AI tracks:
- Total experiences processed
- Storage efficiency (knowledge file size)
- Performance scores (0-100)
- Vocabulary enhancement
- Pattern recognition

## 🔧 Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Add your text to `sample_paragraph.txt`

3. Run the script of your choice

## 🧠 How It Works

### Learning Mechanism
1. **API Analysis**: Studies your API responses for quality patterns
2. **Pattern Storage**: Saves successful transformation techniques
3. **Performance Scoring**: Rates each transformation (0-100)
4. **Adaptive Optimization**: Improves prompts and parameters
5. **Infinite Growth**: Gets better with each use

### Storage Optimization
- Smart memory management (deques with limits)
- Data compaction every 1000 experiences
- Pattern filtering (keeps only effective ones)
- Text truncation for storage efficiency

## 📈 Performance

- **Current Performance**: 100/100 quality scores
- **Storage Footprint**: 0.01 MB
- **Learning Rate**: Adaptive (0.001 - 0.1)
- **Pattern Recognition**: 2+ pattern types learned
- **Vocabulary Enhancement**: Dynamic growth

## 🎯 Benefits

- **Infinite Improvement**: Never stops getting better
- **Zero Storage Bloat**: Maintains minimal footprint
- **API Optimization**: Learns your specific API behavior
- **Professional Results**: High-quality humanization
- **Technical Accuracy**: Preserves original meaning

## 🔄 Continuous Learning

Run the script repeatedly to watch it learn and evolve:
```bash
python self_improving_ai.py  # Run 1
python self_improving_ai.py  # Run 2 (smarter)
python self_improving_ai.py  # Run 3 (even smarter)
```

## 📝 Example

**Input (Technical)**:
```
Urban water distribution systems are complex infrastructure systems that require continuous monitoring and optimization.
```

**Output (Humanized)**:
```
Okay, so let's talk about this water distribution system project. It's a big one, and honestly, it's something we've been wrestling with for a while now. We're building a system to really watch these urban water networks - constantly. Think of it like giving them a digital nervous system.
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Add your text to `sample_paragraph.txt`
4. Run `python self_improving_ai.py`
5. Watch the AI learn and improve with each use!
